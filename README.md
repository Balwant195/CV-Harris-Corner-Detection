# Harris Corner Detection for Image Processing and Computer Vision

This repository contains an implementation of Harris Corner Detection, a crucial technique in computer vision for identifying corners in images, which are points where the intensity changes significantly in multiple directions.

## Features

- Robust corner detection using the Harris Corner algorithm
- Customizable parameters: corner detection sensitivity (k) and threshold
- Efficient handling of image gradients and corner response calculation
- Easy integration into computer vision workflows

## Applications

- **Feature Matching**: Enhance feature matching for image stitching or recognition.
- **Object Detection**: Detect specific objects within an image based on corner features.
- **Motion Detection**: Track movement by detecting and following corner points.
- **3D Reconstruction**: Infer depth information and reconstruct 3D scenes using corner points.

## Acknowledgments

This implementation was developed as part of a computer vision course taught at the Indian Statistical Institute by Professor Pradipta Maji, Professor at the Machine Intelligence Unit, Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata, located at 203 B. T. Road, Kolkata 700108, India, from August 2022 to December 2022.
